'Friendly/charitable License'(-DRAFT. Talk to us? ☺ if you are into international law):
We seek to work together empowering every good-willed user, contributor & partner, as openly & fairly as reasonably possible 
FREEDOMS: 
1. PERSONAL use:  This was made for you ♡. (If you like it consider passing on the favor. Or donating. Our work is efficient.) If you ever change or repurpose something, consider sharing that ♡. )
1.1. Commercial BACKEND use: A fair price / support of this project is suggested for long-term use & mandatory in companies valued above $0.2 Million or 2 times the national GDP per capita, whichever number is bigger. 
     Your edits/additions are not required to inherit the exact license, because your work might lead in a totally different direction.
       (However you should intend charity. So you should either provider your work under this license or GNU or MIT or otherwise have good reasons and lead a public discussion/debate about them. Unless all of the previous would be in conflict with public wellness.
2. CONTRIBUTORs: Unlike popular licences we would like to acknowledge that you become a shareholder of this project / 'cooperative',  proportionally to the time well spent.
  Please vote about our future actions. Seeking decentralization of powers might protect charity & friendliness.   
    2.1. (option): For intellectual growth & compatiblity with the standard:  All accepted pull-requests are assumed, 
         to also come under a viral copyleft license, GNU agpl-3.0-7abcdef, for the world, unless stated otherwise,
         2.2. (option/small projects): , but free of copyrights to the original cause & maintainers. (these intellectual contributions are granted to the exact original cause & maintainers free-of-charge, non-exclusively, for publishing & modification. Contributors do have the right to be mentioned in credits)
3. DISTRIBUTION: Unmodified publishing welcome! permitted. (just don't wrap it in ads or drive-by installs)
  3.1 Modified Versions or piece/s of our code:  
   - Registered Charity organisations: you can modify / repurpose (Just don't remove our links or state the source well.)
   - RESTRICTION: commercially publishing/repurosing any of the code, that is not the full. 
     Written permission/contract is required. No such permission was granted to anybody as of 2022. Exception: OS's like Debian, Fedora.

COMMENT/Postamble: Reason for the specific restriction:  Some publishers use code without permission commercially, with [many] ads or spyware. 
Together they can have more users than the original, since software is often not chosen well. 
Thus we rationally/responsibly have to care. Inspite of the tendency for smart behavior, to be superior on a long-term, as assumed by licences like GNU, 
marketing / competition / economy are not fair in the present.  Billions of users don't review every software choice
 - While most project owners are unlikely to hinder any good cause by requiring to ask, which might help and connect contributors
(and each owner can pass on their work prior to retiring, 
i.e. Option: Once the maintainers/founders/initiators/inventors of this Repo become inactive for X month, 
the community might vote for successors with a 60% majority. If no election is successful within Y month, then a Repositorium becomes licensed under GNU apgl-3.0-7abcdef )
