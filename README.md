###### _Opportunity:_  
  - a Developer's work can sometimes be leveraged easily, so that it saves 1000s of times more human effort collectively than it costs  the one or few developers...! - Or electricity too 
    -  And still in the (far) future, if society progresses and the amount of developers grows, there will still be little features never made or published before, that 10000 smart people were waiting for already - or that millions would enjoy *if* only they ever see it structured efficiently. 
        - So translating, documenting, structuring, planning is also efficient/motivating and increasingly essential

###### _Unforunately:_ 
 - Many of the biggest AND most meanigful ideas still were never realized due to lack of money /confidence.
And many altruistic geniuses are introverted - or rather just used to work alone, since it can seem more likely to reach unique, relevant spheres alone, 
while any teams also require **some** organisational overhead.  
However, once you choose a unique, relevant cause, there often already is good use for your more specific talents, that no single person has at once. 
And other skills / experience, such as native language.  -  
 - Most strikingly: 5 developers can make one great project worth much more than 5 incomplete ones. Useless redundances can be avoided early.
Yet often several people each work on the same cause/purpose/project needlessly. And never come together and even abandon their version sooner or later. (Which might sometimes be reasonable personally, yet contra-productive for their cause. 
. A single person's energy simply is limited, but a project can easily be too big or too lengthy, and last for 'too' many years. (Assuming projects should persist beyond single person's energy not to needlessly confuse every user at one point.)
